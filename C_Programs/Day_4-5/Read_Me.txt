// Here Day 4-5 Problems are solved and Uploaded.

1. WAP to sort the given array in ascending and descending order.

2. Write a program to swap two numbers using function.

3. WAP to find minimum and maximum elements in a given array using the function int 
find_max_min(int array[], int size, int *max, int *min);

4. Write a C program that take 2 integer sets A[] and B[] as input and prints results of 
following set operations:
I. A union B (Write function set_union())
II. A intersection B (Write function set_intersection())
III. A-B and B-A (Write function set_difference())
                  
5. WAP to store 10 numbers in an array. Remove the duplicate entries in the array.
                  
6. WAP to search for a given integer in an array using the linear search technique.
                  
7. WAP to search for a given integer in an array using the binary search technique
                  
8. Write a C program, that reads list of n integer and print sum of product of consecutive 
numbers. if n=7 and numbers are 4,5,2,5,6,4,7 then output is 
4*5+5*2+2*5+5*6+6*4+4*7 = 122.
                  
9. WAP to read a string from the user and find the length of string.( Note: Do not use 
string.h header file)
                  
10. Input date, month and year from the user, and using switch case, display in 
worded format. e.g. input: d=16, m=7, y=1992 
Output: 16th July, 1992
                  
11. Write a function that will scan a character string passed as an argument and convert 
all lower-case characters into their upper-case equivalents.
                  
12. Write a program to read a string from the user and reverse the string.( Note: Do not 
use string.h header file)
                  
13. Write a program to check whether the given input string is palindrome.
                  
14. Write a program to concatenate two stings. .( Note: Do not use string.h header file)
                  
15. WAP to construct 5 * 5 matrix and display the contents. Use functions for 
construction and display of matrix.
                  
16. Given a matrix of size NxN, find itâ€™s Transpose.
                  
17. Given a matrix of size NxM. Find the sum of each column in the matrix.
                  
18. WAP program to check if given matrix is a sparse matrix. If the number of zeros in a 
matrix exceeds (n*m)/2, where n, m is the dimension of the matrix, matrix is sparse 
matrix. Sparse matrix has more zero elements than nonzero elements.
